Some tools require you to select a junction before you can use them...

# Usage

## Choose tool

If you haven't already done so, select the desired tool from the [Toolbar](Toolbar.md):

* [Junction Restrictions](Junction-Restrictions.md)
* [Lane Connectors](Lane-Connectors.md)
* [Priority Signs](Priority-Signs.md)
* [Traffic Lights](Traffic Lights)

## Select

Move the mouse over a junction on the map; if it can be selected, a circle will appear:

(todo: image)

**Click** the circle to select the junction, then customise it as desired.

## Deselect

**Right-click** to deselect the junction.

> Some tools have nested levels of interaction, which themselves can be exited by right-clicking, so you might need to right-click a few times to deselect a junction.

Alternatively, you can press **Esc** to exit the active tool completely.
