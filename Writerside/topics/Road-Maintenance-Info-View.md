Red roads are poorly maintained.

## Impact on driving speed

Vehicles can drive slightly faster on well maintained roads.

However, if you have enabled **Road condition has a bigger impact on vehicle speed** in [Gameplay](Gameplay.md) [settings](Settings.md):

* Unmaintained roads are slower
* Wet/flooded roads will be significantly slower

For detailed information, see: [Road Conditions](Road Conditions)

## How to fix

To help vehicles drive faster:

* Use the **Road Maintenance** service to improve **road condition**
* Use the **Pumping** service to remove **water/flooding**
