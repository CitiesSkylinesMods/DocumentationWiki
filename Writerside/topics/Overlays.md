# Overlay Settings

> Verified: March 2022 â€” TM:PE 11.6.5.1

[](Settings.md): [](General.md) | [](Gameplay.md) | [](Policies.md)
| **Overlays** | [](Maintenance.md) | [Keybindings](Keybinds.md)

## Overview

Use these [](Settings.md) to create persistent overlays:

* They will be visible whenever the [](Toolbar.md) is visible
* To reduce clutter, only non-default customizations are shown
* They are not interactive, unless the associated tool is active

## Settings

### Tool overlays:

_Use these options to choose which overlays are shown..._

* [](Priority-Signs.md)
* [](Timed-Traffic-Lights.md)
* [](Speed-Limits.md)
* [](Vehicle-Restrictions.md)
* [](Parking-Restrictions.md)
* [](Junction-Restrictions.md)
* Connected Lanes = [](Lane-Connectors.md)

### Developer overlays:

> These overlays are not intended for normal gameplay; they are very slow.

_Use these overlays to show information about [Nodes, Segments and Lanes](Nodes,-Segments,-Lanes.md)..._

* **Nodes and Segments** - displays IDs of nodes and segments on the map
* **Lanes** - displays IDs and other details of lanes on the map

### Pathfinder overlays:

_Use this option to display number of queued tasks in the pathfinding manager..._

* **Path Find Stats** - unlike other overlays, pathfinder stats are shown in green text under the
  main [](Toolbar.md).

### Debug overlays:

> These overlays are only available in `DEBUG` builds of the mod used by developers.

* **Vehicles**
* **Citizens**
* **Buildings**

## FAQ

**Do they affect frame rate or cause lag?**
> Yes, but only while the [](Toolbar.md) is visible. The debug overlays, in particular, are extremely slow.

**An enabled overlay doesn't show**
> * Ensure corresponding features are enabled in [](Maintenance.md).
> * The [](Toolbar.md) must be visible to see the overlays.
> * Distant overlays are hidden; move camera closer to reveal them.

**Some icons disappear from overlays if associated tool is not active**
> * To reduce clutter and reduce lag, only _non-default_ customizations are shown (anything using default values is
    hidden).
> * If a tool is active (on the [](Toolbar.md)), its associated overlay will always show full detail.
