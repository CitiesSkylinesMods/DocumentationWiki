The [vanilla game and DLC policies](https://skylines.paradoxwikis.com/Policies) can affect traffic in your city in many
ways...

## Vehicle Restrictions

> These are separate to TM:PE's [](Vehicle-Restrictions.md), and in effect act as an additional layer
> of restrictions.

* **Bike ban on sidewalks** (After Dark DLC)
    * Cyclists cannot use sidewalks (pavements) and must instead use bike paths or dedicated cycle lanes
    * Can cause more road traffic as cims resort to using their cars or taxis
    * See also: Encourage biking
* **Combustion engine ban** (Green Cities DLC)
    * Prevents combustion engine cars from using the roads
    * Can push more cims, particularly tourists, to use public transport
    * See also: Electric Cars policy
* **Heavy traffic ban**
    * Blocks cargo vehicles from using the roads
    * Similar to TM:PE cargo vehicle restriction, but applied to a district instead of individual roads
* **Old town** (After Dark DLC)
    * Only residents can use the area for motor vehicles
    * Blocks non-local traffic
    * Also blocks some public transport vehicles (likely a bug, see #371)

## Transport preferences

> These determine what kinds of transport cims prefer to use or must use.

* **Come one, come all** (Stadiums in Match Day DLC)
    * This is actually a Stadium policy
    * When enabled, cims will prefer public transport when attending matches at the stadium
* **Encourage biking** (After Dark DLC)
    * Cims try to cycle more often, reducing road vehicle usage
    * See also: Bike ban on sidewalks
* **Electric cars** (Green Cities DLC)
    * Cims living in the area are forced to buy electric vehicles
    * See also: Combustion engine ban
* **Free public transport**
    * Cims much more likely to use your public transport services
    * Only applies to bus, tram, metro, monorail, and local train fares.
    * For district policies, only passengers _leaving_ from that district will get a free ride.
    * Intercity trains, cargo trains, ships, planes and taxis will still continue to provide revenue, regardless.
* **High ticket prices** (Mass Transit DLC)
    * Fewer cims use public transport (so more road traffic and congestion)
* **Prefer ferries** (Mass Transit DLC)
    * Cims will try and use ferry service if it is available
