## Symptom

In your log file, you see an error like:

* `Simulation error: EndDeserialize(GameAreaManager) tag mismatch`

## Cause

This happens when you save a city with [81 Tiles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=576327847) mod active, but then later load that city without the 81 Tiles mod.

## Solution

The [81 Tiles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=576327847) mod must be active when the city is loaded.

## Fixed?

If not, check the workshop page for 81 Tiles.
