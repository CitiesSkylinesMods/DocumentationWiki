# Enter Blocked Junctions

Use this feature to improve traffic flow through close-proximity junctions, such as micro-roundabouts.

### Overview

By default, vehicles are not allowed to enter a blocked junction. This ensures that oncoming traffic can flow freely.

However, if you have two or more junctions that are close together, such as connecting roads on a small roundabout, or a
street with lots of side roads, forcing vehicles to wait for their target lane to become free can result in traffic
jams.

Take this road as an example:

There's not much space between each of those junctions, so vehicles will have to keep stopping and starting while they
wait for the next bit of the road to clear.

To get round this problem, you can allow vehicles to enter blocked junctions.

### Enable

Before you can use this feature, you have to enable **Junction Restrictions** in the [](Maintenance.md)
settings.

### Customise

If you want to customise individual junctions, use the [](Junction-Restrictions.md) tool.

To allow vehicles to enter blocked junctions across the entire map, enable **Vehicles may enter blocked junctions**
in [](Policies.md) in [](Settings.md). You can still override individual junctions if you want to.
