Red buildings indicate places where cims struggled to find parking. Often they'll have to drive around looking for somewhere else to park and, if they can't find anywhere, they'll give up.

## How to fix

* Good public transport reduces need to drive
* Provide more parking:
    * On-road parking is a quick fix
    * Place car parks nearby if you need lots of extra parking
* Make sure there are plenty of places for cims to cross the road
    * If they can't find a place to cross, they won't park there
* Ensure traffic can turn round to reach parking on the other side of the road
    * This is particularly important on medium and large roads
* Check that you haven't disabled on-road parking
