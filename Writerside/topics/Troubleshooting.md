## Known bugs

We have replicated the following bugs and have temporary workarounds:

* [#277](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/issues/277) (vanilla game bug): Vehicles despawning near recently
  altered roads or rails
    * Caused by
      a [bug in vanilla game](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/cities-skylines-steam-vibrating-node-replicable-bug.1187861/)
      which CO are investigating
    * How to fix - see: [](How-to-remove-ghost-nodes-and-broken-nodes.md)
* [#273](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/issues/273) (vanilla game bug): Tourists unable to leave via 2-way
  outside connections
    * Try the [Crazy Tourists Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1759269367) mod
* [#244](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/issues/244): Changing roads (adding junctions, upgrading, etc.)
  breaks nearby transport routes.
    * Caused by Network Extensions 2 (NExt2)
    * How to fix - replace NExt2 roads with normal road asset replicas: [](How-to-remove-workshop-networks.md)

> Tip: Our feature documentation pages often have an "Issues" link at the bottom which will display currently known
> problems and ideas for that feature.
