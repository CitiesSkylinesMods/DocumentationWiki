> About 50% of the error reports we get are due to old / broken / incompatible mods. The [Compatibility Report](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633433869) mod is the fastest way to find known problems with your mods - it's a collaboration between end-users and mod developers to help navigate the vast array of mods that are out there.
