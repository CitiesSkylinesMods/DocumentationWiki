# Flying Trees

## Symptom

* Trees are floating in the air  
  ![](picFloatingTree_bug.png)

## Cause

This is caused by having both the following mods enabled at the same time:

* [Tree Snapping](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869134690) mod
* [Unlimited Trees](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=455403039) mod

_Thanks to Discord user **nilepereiraa** for this tip._

## Solution

Remove one of the mods, exit the game to desktop and then reload your save, it should be fixed.

> Tip: You can use [Prop and Tree Anarchy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=593588108) mod as an
> alternative to Tree Snapping mod ;)

## Was it Fixed?

If not you might need to drag-select all the trees with Move It! mod and then align them to terrain.
