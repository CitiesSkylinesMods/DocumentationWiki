# Symptom

Log file (and possibly on-screen error message) shows hundreds or even thousands of repetitions of this error:

* `System.ArgumentNullException: '' with 1 arguments.`

# Cause

This error is _not_ caused by TM:PE.

It is caused by a bug in the [CNL Blank Road Name](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1298626701) or [CNL Japanese Blank Road Name](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301101044) mod.

# Solution

Unsubscribe whichever CNL Blank Road Name mod you are using.

# Fixed?

If not, ask for advice in the Steam forums as it might be some other mod (not TM:PE).
