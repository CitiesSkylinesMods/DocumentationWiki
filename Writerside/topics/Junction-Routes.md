There are three types of route a vehicle can take across a junction:

* Unprotected turn
* Permissive turn
* Protected turn

### Unprotected turns

The driver has priority over other traffic, but there is a risk of collision.

(todo: diagram)

### Permissive turns

The driver can enter the junction, but must yield to other traffic.

(todo: diagram)

In reality this is still an unprotected turn, because there's still a risk of collision. However, the driver has to yield to other traffic, reducing that risk.

### Protected turns

The driver must stop and wait for the lights to change before they can enter the junction.

(todo: diagram)

Protected turns are the safest, because they ensure dedicated passage for the vehicle when it crosses the junction.
