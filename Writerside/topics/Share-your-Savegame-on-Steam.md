### Why we need the savegame

We can investigate and fix bugs faster if we can replicate them - the easiest way to achieve that is with a savegame shared to the workshop (and the URL to its page in the workshop).

You can keep your mods enabled when sharing; the more closely we can replicate your game setup the more chance we have of recreating the bug you are seeing.

### Uploading a savegame to Steam

* From **Main Menu**, choose [**Content Manager**](https://skylines.paradoxwikis.com/Content_Manager)
* Select the **Savegames** and locate your savegame in the list
* Click the **Share** button, and follow the onscreen instructions
* Exit Cities: Skylines

### Getting the savegame URL

Find your savegame in the Steam Workshop:

* Click on your username at the top of the Steam app, and choose **View My Profile**
* Choose the **Workshop Items** link
* Click your savegame to view it's details page

If there is a warning about the file being private or friends only:

* Click **Change Visibility** in the sidebar
* Set it to **Public** (otherwise we won't be able to subscribe to it)

Now copy the URL shown at the top of the savegame **Description** page.

It will look something like this:

> ```https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1564441481```

Send us your URL and we'll be able to load your savegame and hopefully reproduce the error you were having.

### Where to post the URL

Post the link wherever it was you were discussing the problem (usually a Steam discussion topic or comments section).

For TM:PE users only:

* If it relates to an existing **GitHub** issue, ensure the issue contains a description of the problem.
    * To create a new issue, see: [Report a bug](Report a bug)
* If you're communicating via **Discord** please also include a brief description of the problem as well (we answer lots of support queries and it's difficult to remember who's posting what and why they are posting it).
