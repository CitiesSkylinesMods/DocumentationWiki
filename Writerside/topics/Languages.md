It defaults to same language as game, but you can select different language
via [General](General.md) [settings](Settings.md).

## Language mods

TM:PE is compatible with other language mods:

* Game languages - TM:PE should recognise the locale and set its language accordingly
* Custom Name Lists

> TM:PE devs: Custom game locales are handled
> in [`SetCurrentLanguageToGameLanguage()`](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/blob/master/TLM/TLM/UI/Localization/Translation.cs)

## Help us translate!

Translations are contributed via our project on the Crowdin website.

If you want to help us translate TM:PE, please read our [Localisation Guidelines](Localisation.md) first.

Note: The game currently doesn't have proper support for RTL languages, such as Arabic, however we are working on our
own custom UI system which could support that in the future.
