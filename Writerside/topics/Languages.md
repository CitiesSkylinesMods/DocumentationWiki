It defaults to same language as game, but you can select different langauge via [General](General) [settings](settings).

## Language mods

TM:PE is compatible with other language mods:

* Game languages - TM:PE should recognise the locale and set its language accordingly  
* Custom Name Lists

> TM:PE devs: Custom game locales are handled in [`SetCurrentLanguageToGameLanguage()`](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/blob/master/TLM/TLM/UI/Localization/Translation.cs)

Note: The game currently doesn't have proper support for RTL languages, such as Arabic, however we are working on our own custom UI system which could support that in future.
