# Helicopters and Trucks From Wrong Depots

## Symptoms

One or more of the following happen:

* Helicopters spawning from fire/police/ambulance stations
* Trucks spawning from fire/police/ambulance helicopter depots
* Ships, trains and planes not spawning

## Causes

This can be caused by broken mod (such as Service Vehicle Selector 2), vehicle asset (e.g. wrong AI), or building
asset (e.g. wrong spawn points used).

> Asset authors: If your vehicle exhibits this bug, try reconstructing it and re-upload to workshop (thanks
> Ninjanoobslayer for the tip!)

_We are not aware of any TM:PE bugs causing this issue at present._

## Solutions

* Did you subscribe to a service vehicle asset recently (or was one updated)?
    * If so, try disabling or unsubscribing it.
    * If that fixes it, please let us know, so we can add it to [](Broken-Vehicle-Assets.md) list
    * See also: [Steam discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/discussions/0/2666626567704943789/)
* Do you have any mods that alter how services work?
    * Try disabling them, exit to desktop, then reload game to see if that fixes it.
    * If that fixes it, please let us know which mod was causing the problem.
    * [Service Vehicle Selector 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=934994075) is known to cause
      the problem ([steam discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/discussions/0/1742265730179840204/))
