# Array Index - Symptom 8

> Article verified: September 2019

> This is one cause of the [](Simulation-error-Array-index-is-out-of-range.md) error.

## Symptom

You will see this error:

* `Simulation error: Array index is out of range.`

In the [**log file**](Share-your-Cities-Skylines-log-file.md), you'll see one of the following below the error:

* `at UnlockManager.Unlocked ...`

## Cause

This appears to be caused by Network Extensions 2 mod, however it is very rare error which only affects small number of
users.

> WARNING: Don't just unsubscribe NExt2; go through procedure in the Solution section first.

We suspect the issue is actually another mod conflicting with NExt2, maybe some sort of milestone unlocker mod?

## Solution

Try disabling any milestone or building unlocker mods you have, exit to desktop then restart game and see if that helps.

Failing that, you would need to disable or unsubscribe Network Extensions 2 - there is a very specific process for doing
that, see: [](How-to-remove-workshop-networks.md)
