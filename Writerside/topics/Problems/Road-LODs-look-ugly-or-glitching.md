# Road LODs Look Ugly or Glitching

> Article verified: June 2019

## Symptom

When zoomed out, road LODs are either:

* Showing wrong color (e.g. they look more like gravel or concrete)
* Turning in to massive spikes that reach in to the sky (usually at junctions)

## Causes

These issues aren't caused by TM:PE, they are caused by other mods.

Wrong colors can be caused by either:

* Issues with road (or other network) assets
* Loading Screen Mod sharing textures

Large spikes are generally caused by badly designed road (or other network) assets.

## Solutions

For wrong colors:

* Disable "Share textures" in [Loading Screen Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667342976)
  options screen
* Failing that, check if the issue only affects certain roads/networks and either:
    * Remove them from the map and use other alternatives, or
    * Increase "Network LOD Distance"

For huge sky spikes:

* Check if the issue only affects certain roads/networks and either:
    * Clus' [LRT networks](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1560202570) (which are awesome, btw)
      sometimes cause this problem
    * Remove them from the map and use other alternatives, or
    * Increase "Network LOD Distance"
