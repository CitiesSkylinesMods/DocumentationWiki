# Policies Panel Missing

> Verified: March 2022 - TM:PE 11.6.5.1

Note: This issue relates to the vanilla game [](https://skylines.paradoxwikis.com/Policies), _not_ the TM:
PE [](Policies.md).

## Symptoms

* When accessing city or district policies, the tabbed panel that contains the policies does not appear

## Cause

This issue is _not_ caused by TM:PE.

It is a long-standing bug in the vanilla game.

## Solution

These things can revive the policies panel:

* Install [Loading Screen Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2731207699) - it will try to fix
  the issue automatically; or
* Build a metro and connect some metro track to it; or
* Build some new ploppable buildings; or
* Temporarily switch to a different language in game settings, then back to your language.

Any of those things should reset the policies panel.
