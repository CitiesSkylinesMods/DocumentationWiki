# Industry and Commercial Vehicles not Working

## Symptoms

* Some or all road-based cargo vehicles become "stuck" and can't make deliveries/collections

## Cause

* [#1115](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/issues/1115): Setting vehicle speed, acceleration, or braking too
  fast confuses vehicle AIs
* Similar issues may occur if the stats are set too low

## Solution

* If you customized the vehicle stats using a mod (e.g. AVO, Customize It, etc.), try resetting them to default.
* If it's a workshop asset, check its speed, acceleration and breaking stats compared to other vehicles:
    * Use [Advanced Vehicle Options](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1548831935) (recommended)
      or [Customize It: Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1806759255)
    * Try setting stats of the vehicle exhibiting problems to the stats of a working vehicle
    * If the vehicle has trailers, the stats of trailers should be set to same/similar values as the main vehicle
