> Only the most important shortcuts are listed; for a full list of shortcuts for each tool, refer to the documentation
> page in the wiki.

## Usage

The hints panel is visible by default. You can toggle it on/off by clicking the small ❔ icon in the top-right corner of
the [](Toolbar.md):

## Context-sensitive

Note that the content of the hints panel will update depending on what you're doing.

For example, there are several layers of interaction in the [](Lane-Connectors.md) tool, and the hints panel guides you
every step of the way:
