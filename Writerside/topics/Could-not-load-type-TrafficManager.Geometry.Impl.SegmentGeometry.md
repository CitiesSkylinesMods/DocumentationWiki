## Symptom

You see an error on-screen or in the [log file](Share-your-Cities-Skylines-log-file.) like this:

* `Could not load type 'TrafficManager.Geometry.Impl.SegmentGeometry' from assembly ...`

## Cause

It's caused by [Advanced Junction Rule](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1647686914) mod which has now been removed from the Steam Workshop.

Unlike assets, when a mod is removed from workshop it doesn't get automatically deleted from your locak hard disk. You will need to remove it manually.

## Solution

* Open **Main Menu > Content Manager > Mods**
* Find and remove **Advanced Junction Rule** mod (click small "(x)" button)
* Exit to desktop, then reload the game
