# Flickering Blue Road Building Guides

> Article verified: October 2019

## Symptom

When building roads (and maybe rails too) the blue road guides flicker ([video](https://imgur.com/a/LtlLHrq)).

## Cause

We haven't identified the exact cause yet, but some users report it's due
to [Network Skins 2 Beta](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1758376843).

## Solution

Try disabling Network Skins 2 and restart the game (exit to desktop then reload game).

## Was it Fixed?

If not, ask in the main C:SL discussions on Steam or Reddit - hopefully someone will know what's causing it (let us
know!)
