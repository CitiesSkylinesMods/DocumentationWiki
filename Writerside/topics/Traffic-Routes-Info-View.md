# Traffic Routes Info View

> Verified: January 2022 - TM:PE 11.5.2 / TM:PE 11.6

## Overview

The **Traffic Routes** info view allows you to examine active transport routes in your city.

With the info view active, you can click any of the following to see associated routes:

* Buildings and stations
    * Shows routes of cims travelling to and from the building
* Roads, train tracks, metro tunnels, etc.
    * Shows all vehicle routes that will drive over the selected segment
* Vehicles of any kind
    * Shows where the vehicle is going to
* Pedestrians and cyclists
    * Works the same way as vehicles (see above)

> Selecting any road in this view activates [](Adjust-Roads.md) panel which provides bulk applicators
> for [](High-Priority-Roads.md) and [](Roundabout-Policies.md).

## Real Time mod

If you have [**Real Time**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1420955187) mod enabled, you'll also
notice some buildings are highlighted on the Traffic Routes info view:

Red buildings indicate that journey times are taking _too long_, and in some cases it will cause cims to abandon their
journey and return home.

## How to fix

* Optimize your road network to help traffic reach its destination more quickly
    * On busy routes, reducing the number of junctions helps a lot!
    * Adding more lanes usually makes things worse (lane changes cause traffic jams!)
    * Create fast 'bypass routes' for 'through traffic'
* Provide good public transport along popular routes
    * Bus lanes allow buses to drive past traffic jams
    * Add some express routes which skip stops but reach destination faster
* Use pedestrian and bike paths to create shortcuts to and from transit hubs
