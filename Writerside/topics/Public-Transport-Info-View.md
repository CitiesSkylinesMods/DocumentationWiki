Red buildings are those which are difficult to reach.

## Incoming vs. Outgoing demand

If you have [](Parking-AI.md) enabled, you will notice a button near the top of the info view which allows you
to toggle between incoming and outgoing demand:

* **Incoming demand:** Indicates which buildings are difficult to reach via public transport
* **Outgoing demand:** Indicates that cims leaving the building were struggling to reach their destination via public
  transport

## Using the routes view

You can use the routes info view to see where cims are coming from and going to, in relation to a specific building.

* Click the building
* On the info panel, click the Routes icon

You will be shown the [](Traffic-Routes-Info-View.md) which will indicate all active routes to and
from the building.

## How to fix

There are several ways to help cims get around by public transport:

* Determine common transport patterns using the [](Traffic-Routes-Info-View.md):
    * Add transport routes between popular sources and destinations
* Cims take journey time and cost in to consideration when planning their transport:
    * They might prefer an express bus service or train to save time
* Use pedestrian and bike paths to encourage cims to ditch their cars
* Provide a taxi service to help cims reach transport hubs
