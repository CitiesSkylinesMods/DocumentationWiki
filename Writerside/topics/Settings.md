## Settings tabs

The settings are arranged in tabs, for more info click links below:

* [General](General.md) - UI, mod checker, etc.
* [Gameplay](Gameplay.md) - various gameplay options
* [Policies](Policies.md) - set city-wide default policies, etc
* [Overlays](Overlays.md) - enable persistent overlays
* [Maintenance](Maintenance.md) - enable mod features, etc.
* [Keybinds](Keybinds.md) - keyboard shortcuts

Settings are saved directly to the save game, so you can have different settings on different cities.

## Fine tuning

Advanced settings can be customised via [Global Configuration](Global-Configuration.md) file on disk. If changing the file
whilst in-game, use the **Reload Global Configuration** button in [Maintenance](Maintenance.md) settings to make changes
take effect.

## FAQ

#### Settings don't work from main menu

> Currently only some basic settings, such as language, can be changed from the **Main Menu**. Everything else needs to
> be changed from the in-game **Pause Menu**.

#### Can I set default settings so all new cities use them?

> Not currently. It's something we want to do, but just haven't found the time. :/
