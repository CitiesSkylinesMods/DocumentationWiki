## Settings tabs

The settings are arranged in tabs, for more info click links below:

* [General](General) - UI, mod checker, etc.
* [Gameplay](Gameplay) - various gameplay options
* [Policies](Policies) - set city-wide default policies, etc
* [Overlays](Overlays) - enable persistent overlays
* [Maintenance](Maintenance) - enable mod features, etc.

Advanced settings can be customised via [Global Configuration](Global Configuration) file on disk. If changing the file whilst in-game, use the **Reload Global Configuration** button in [Maintenance](Maintenance) settings to make changes take effect.

## FAQ

#### Settings don't work from main menu
> Currently only some basic settings, such as language, can be changed from the **Main Menu**. Everything else needs to be changed from the in-game **Pause Menu**.

#### Can I set default settings so all new cities use them?
> Not currently. It's something we want to do, but just haven't found the time. :/
