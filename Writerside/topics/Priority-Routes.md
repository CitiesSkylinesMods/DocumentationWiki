## Overview

In real world when an alley joins a main road the central barrier remain unbroken (as in picture below). TMPE can functionally simulate this by setting the following traffic rules:

* ban pedestrian crossing on the main road
* cars in the main road can enter blocked junction while cars on the alley need to keep clear.
* cars entering the main road shall yield.
* no left turns from/into the alleys.
