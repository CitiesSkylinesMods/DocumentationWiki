## Cause

> This issue is _not_ caused by TM:PE.

A known cause of this issue is `81 Tiles` mod when you have purchased map tiles one at a time.

## Solution

* Select the asset with `Move It` mod, then use its `Reset Objects` feature
* Sometimes moving the object will resolve the issue
* Further occurrences of the issue can be prevented by purchasing all tiles
    * ...using the button in `81 Tiles` mod options
    * Note: More tiles = more workload for CPU = may cause lag/stutter in-game
