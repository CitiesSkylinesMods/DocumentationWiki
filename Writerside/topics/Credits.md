## Code

It has taken a huge amount of effort by [many people over many years](https://github.com/krzychu124/Cities-Skylines-Traffic-Manager-President-Edition/network/members) to get it to where it is today. We are just the current maintainers, and there will hopefully be many more after us.

See [Changelog](https://github.com/krzychu124/Cities-Skylines-Traffic-Manager-President-Edition/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for full history of TM:PE, including all the earlier mods that merged in to it.
