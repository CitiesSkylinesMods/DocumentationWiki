We are hugely appreciative of anyone who can help us translate TM:PE in to other Languages.

Click a language to view it's files...

## Language files

TM:PE translations are split in to several language files, which look like this:

> ![TM:PE Language Files](https://i.imgur.com/TUjwpyel.png)

The progress bar depicts the current status of each file:

* Green = Approved translations
* Blue = Pending approval
* Grey = Missing translations

Click a language file to display it's strings...

## Translation strings

The translations strings are listed in the column on the left:

> ![TM:PE Strings](https://i.imgur.com/JR4tM63.png)

The icons on the left show the status of each string:

* Red square with a dot = Not yet translated
* Green square = Translated, but not yet approved
* Check mark = Approved translation

Click on any string to show its detail screen:

> ![TM:PE String detail](https://i.imgur.com/qXXaWdXl.png)

In the top box you'll see the **Source string**, which is the **key** TM:PE uses to locate a translation.

Each source string includes a **prefix followed by a colon** - in the example above it's `Checkbox:`. Do NOT include the prefix in your translated string; you only need to translate the text _after_ the `:` - in the example above that would be `Ignore disabled mods`.

The **Context** section provides some additional detail about where the string is used, often with a screenshot. If you click a screenshot you'll see a red box depicting where the string is used.

Below the context panel, the current translation (if there is one) is shown. Add or edit the translation, then click the **Save** button to submit it for approval.

> You may see some on-screen warnings when saving, like this:
> ![TM:PE Save warning](https://i.imgur.com/8k9G4W8.png)  
> Ignore them and click the "Save Anyway" button.

After saving a string, you'll automatically be taken to the next untranslated string in the current file.

_Our team will get notified of any new or changed translations and will review them. Once approved, your translations will go in to TM:PE and will be published with the next update to the workshop page._

## Selecting a different language file

If you've finished making changes in a file and want to switch to another file, click the button in the top-left corner of the screen:

> ![TM:PE Menu button](https://i.imgur.com/0I1NQGZm.png)

You'll see a menu like this:

> ![TM:PE Menu](https://i.imgur.com/dhKSCA8m.png)

Then click "Open..." and you'll get the list of Language files again.
