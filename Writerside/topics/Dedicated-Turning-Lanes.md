> Under construction - see [Lane Arrows](Lane-Arrows.md) docs for now

## Overview

Use these features to create dedicated turning lanes at junctions, which improves:

* Traffic flow through junctions
* Lane usage on roads leading to junctions
* Lane usage within roundabouts
* Fewer cars/trucks using bus lanes

Turning lanes are prioritised as follows:

* Far-side turn
* Near-side turn
* Ahead only

stuff to cover:

- per lane (arrows / lane connectors)
- per segment (alt+click)
- per junction (ctrl+click)
- cycle alternatives https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/pull/755#issue-573092480
- per route: priority bulk app, adjust roads bulk app, roundabout bulk app, etc.
- bus lane restrictions issue #1106

## FAQs

#### Does it affect frame rate or cause lag?
> No.

#### Is it compatible with [Improved Lane Connections](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2119310640) (ILC) mod?
> Yes. Both mods can be used together; you can use [Lane Arrows](Lane-Arrows.md) or [Lane Connectors](Lane-Connectors.md) tools to override the arrows set by ILC mod.
>  
> TM:PE 11.6.0 added a new **Dedicated turning lanes** setting in the [Policies](Policies.md) [settings](Settings.md) which essentially does the same as the ILC mod, but with some extras such as support for central bus lanes.
