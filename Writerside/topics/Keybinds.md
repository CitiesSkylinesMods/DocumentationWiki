## Overview

Use these [](Settings.md) to customise the keyboard shortcuts.

## Settings

To edit a shortcut:

1. `Click shortcut button`
2. Press the key (or combination of keys) you want to use

To delete a shortcut, either:

* `Click the (x) button`, or
* `Click shortcut button` then press `Esc` key

### Global keys

_Use these options to customise general keyboard shortcuts..._

* The **Exit** shortcut will exit, as applicable, from the current selection, the tool, or the toolbar
    * This shortcut is not editable
    * You can often use `Right click` to do the same
* The **Elevation** shortcuts toggle between overground/underground views while a tool is active on
  the [](Toolbar.md)
    * These shortcuts use the keys defined by the game **Build elevation up/down** shortcuts
    * To edit them, go in to games' **Keymapping** screen, and select the **Shared** category
* The **Main Menu** shortcut toggles the [](Toolbar.md)
    * If you're using [Unified UI](Unified-UI.md), this will only work if the `UnifiedUI` panel is open
* The **Tool** shortcuts will activate a tool, but only if the [](Toolbar.md) is visible
    * Tip: Hover the mouse over a button on the toolbar to see the shortcut

### Tool-specific shortcuts

* Most tools provide one or more shortcuts, some of which can be customised
* The context-sensitive [Hints Panel](Hints-Panel.md) lists important shortcuts for the selected tool

## Notes

If you use the [More Shortcuts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685719710) mod, remember to
delete any old shortcuts you were using for TM:PE, so they don't compete with the new shortcuts.

## FAQ

#### Do these settings affect frame rate or cause lag?
