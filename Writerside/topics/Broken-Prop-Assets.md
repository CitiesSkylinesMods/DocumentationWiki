## Broken props

The following assets are broken, you should unsubscribe them:

* [KL Residential Props](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=722043706) - `System.NullReferenceException`

## Invalid texture sizes

These props could potentially cause graphics issues (such as causing other props or assets to have black LODs when zoomed out):

* ~~[Alstom AGV - NTV Italo (Prop Pack)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1596847658) - REVO will update with fixed texture (October 2019)~~ - FIXED!
* [Prop SBB EC/IC/IR PC set](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275358819)
* [ron_fu-ta Train Prop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=549549940) - several props in the collection have invalid texture size

## Tips

* The [Loading Screen Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667342976) has an option to **Check assets for errors** which is very useful for finding broken assets!
* To find bloated vehicle assets, which can reduce frame rate and cause lag, use the [Mesh Info mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=453956891).
