# Documentation

There are two versions of the documentation:

* Documentation 2: https://doc.tmpe.me created from GitHub Wiki data files using Jetbrains Writerside
* Documentation 1: https://github.com/krzychu124/Cities-Skylines-Traffic-Manager-President-Edition/wiki
* Old (website is down, see Wayback Machine internet archive): https://tmpe.viathinksoft.com/wiki/

### Contributing to Documentation 2 (doc.tmpe.me)

* Apply the ordinary GitHub contribution flow (fork, branch, create pull request)
  to https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/DocumentationWiki
* Use British English with Oxford spelling for -ise/-ize words
* Using Jetbrains Writerside really helps, but you don't have to, it's all Markdown!

### Fate of Other Documentation Versions

Old documentation is good as gone, the website is down. You can access it using Wayback Machine internet archive.
Documentation 1 is still available on GitHub.
