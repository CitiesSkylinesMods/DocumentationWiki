> Article verified: January 2020

If you just copy the game to a new drive, things go horribly wrong - especially with mods.

## Correct Procedure:

> Thanks to FireController for this solution!

1. Backup your save games
   * Usually found at `C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Saves` on Windows
   * Alternatively, you can save them to [Steam Cloud](https://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/discussions/0/405693392924366177), but many users say it's unreliable :/
2. [Reinstall Steam desktop](https://www.wikihow.com/Reinstall-Steam-and-Save-Your-Game-Files)
3. Follow this guide: [Moving a Steam Installation and Games](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129)
    * This will ensure you properly move Steam and Games to a new drive
    * Simply copying stuff over manually won't work, you have to do the correct procedure linked above
4. Reinstall Cities: Skylines
    * Steam will automatically download any DLCs and workshop mods/assets you were subscribed to
    * You will need to re-enable mods and check their settings
    * Restore your saved games (Steam will automatically restore any that you stored in Steam Cloud, assuming it works)
