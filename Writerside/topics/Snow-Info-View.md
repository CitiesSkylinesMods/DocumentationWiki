## Overview

> These features require [Snowfall DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420610/Cities_Skylines__Snowfall/).

The **Snow** info view shows how roads are affected by snow.

Red roads are covered in snow, making driving conditions treacherous.

## Impact on driving speed

Snow covered roads have a huge impact on the maximum driving speed.

Additionally, if you have enabled **Road condition has a bigger impact on vehicle speed** in [Gameplay](Gameplay.md) [settings](Settings.md), unmaintained roads will incur additional speed penalties.

For detailed information, see: [Road Conditions](Road Conditions)

## How to fix

To help vehicles drive faster:

* Use the **Snow Plough** service to reduce **snow cover**
* Enable **Studded Tires** [City and District Policies](City and District Policies) minimise the impact of snow
* Use the **Road Maintenance** service to improve **road condition**
