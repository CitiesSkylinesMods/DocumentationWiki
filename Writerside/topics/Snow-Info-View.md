Red roads are covered in snow, making driving conditions treacherous.

## Impact on driving speed

Snow covered roads have a huge impact on the maximum driving speed.

Additionally, if you have enabled **Road condition has a bigger impact on vehicle speed**
in [](Gameplay.md) in [](Settings.md), unmaintained roads will incur additional speed penalties.

For detailed information, see: [](Road-Conditions.md)

## How to fix

To help vehicles drive faster:

* Use the **Snow Plough** service to reduce **snow cover**
* Enable **Studded Tires** [](City-and-District-Policies.md) minimize the impact of snow
* Use the **Road Maintenance** service to improve **road condition**
