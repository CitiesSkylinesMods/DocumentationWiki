## Symptom

* Game toolbar buttons are missing in asset editor

## Cause

_This issue is not caused by TM:PE._

It's caused by Ploppable RICO mod.

## Solution

Disable the RICO mod:

* Navigate to: Main Menu > Content Manager > Mods > Ploppable RICO
* Disable the mod

## Was it Fixed?

If not, there are lots of other mods that don't properly check to see if the asset editor is being used. You'll have to
try disabling them one by one.
