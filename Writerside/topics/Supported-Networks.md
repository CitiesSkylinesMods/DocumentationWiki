# Supported Networks

This page outlines which TM:PE features can be applied to the various networks that are available in the game.

> Although _not_ caused by TM:PE, we recommend all users take care when unsubscribing mods or asset that contain
> networks (roads, paths, rails, etc.), particularly those marked with ⚠️ icon. This is due to a game bug which can break
> save games that were using those networks. For more information,
> see: [](How-to-remove-workshop-networks.md).
>
> Items marked with ❤️ are some of our favourite networks. Note, however, they are often large assets which might cause
> problems on older computers or weak graphics cards.
