# ☠️ Realistic Speeds

> Verified: December 2021 - TM:PE 11.5.2

## Obsolete

This feature has been replaced by [](Individual-Driving-Styles.md).

In TM:PE 10.20 and earlier, this feature caused each vehicle, when spawned, to be given a random speed adjustment. For
more details, see [old TMPE documentation](https://tmpe.viathinksoft.com/wiki/index.php?title=Realistic_speeds).

In TM:PE 10.21, it was replaced by the more advanced **[](Individual-Driving-Styles.md)** feature - each cim has their
own driving style which determines their driving speed and lane changing habits.
