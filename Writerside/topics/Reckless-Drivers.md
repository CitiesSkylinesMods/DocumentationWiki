# Reckless Drivers
> Verified: January 2022 - TM:PE 11.5.2 / TM:PE 11.6

Use this option to make some of your cims drive like lunatics.

## Overview

By default, cims are well behaved and obey your traffic rules and road customisations.

To add realism, you can some of them drive recklessly, causing them to **ignore**:

* [](Speed-Limits.md)
* [](Priority-Signs.md)
* Red [](Traffic-Lights.md)
* [](Lane-Arrows.md)
* [](Vehicle-Restrictions.md)
* [](Parking-Restrictions.md)

However, they will still obey some rules:

* [](Lane-Connectors.md)
* [](Enter-Blocked-Junctions.md) setting in [](Junction-Restrictions.md)

> Note: Emergency vehicles, when responding to emergencies, also drive recklessly, regardless of this setting.

## Usage

To enable reckless drivers, choose a non-zero percentage from the **Reckless Drivers** drop-down list in [](Gameplay.md) in [](Settings.md).

There are no further customisations required. After the feature is enabled, the specified percentage of newly spawned vehicles will be reckless drivers.

The feature can be disabled at any time by changing back to 0% in settings.

## FAQ

**Does this affect frame rate or cause lag?**
> Yes, it puts more strain on your CPU. The effect will be worse for larger cities, particularly those which favour car transport.
