By default, when vehicles get stuck in traffic jams some of them will disappear (despawn) and magically teleport their
passengers or goods wherever they need to go. This keeps the traffic flowing, but it also makes it harder to find
bottlenecks in your road network.

## Usage

Click the **Toggle Despawn** button on the [](Toolbar.md) to toggle it on/off:

|                  Button Icon                   | Meaning                 |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:------------------------|
| ![Despawn prevented](btnDespawn_prevented.png) | Despawning is prevented |
|   ![Despawn allowed](btnDespawn_allowed.png)   | Despawning is allowed   |

You can also use the option in [](Gameplay.md) in [](Settings.md) which does the exact same thing.

## customize

> Requires TM:PE 11.6.5.1 or later.

You can filter which vehicle types the despawn ban affects:

* Click the filter button in [](Gameplay.md) in [](Settings.md), or
* Right-click the **Toggle Despawn** button on the [](Toolbar.md)

Note: Despawning must be disabled before you can customize filters.

The selected vehicle types will always be allowed to despawn. It's particularly useful for allowing jammed trains to
despawn.

## FAQ

**Does this affect frame rate or cause lag?**
> Disabling despawning will result in lots more vehicles on roads and tracks, which can put extra strain on CPU and
> GPU.

**I am a lunatic, how can I get bigger traffic jams?**
> Install the [Real Time](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1420955187) mod, and you will
> experience spectacular traffic jams during rush hour periods. Also, Real Time tracks if cims get to work on time, so
> be sure to check for red buildings on the [](Traffic-Routes-Info-View.md)!
