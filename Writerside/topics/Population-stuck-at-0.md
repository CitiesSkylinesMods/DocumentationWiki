# Symptom

* In a new city, houses are built but nobody moves in to them

# Cause

There can be multiple causes, including:

* Broken highway connection
* Missing mods for outside connections
* Broken station or dock assets
* Lots of other stuff...

# Solution

### Basic requirements

Make sure you have:

* Zoned residential areas
* Water supply to the houses, and sewage outlet too
* Electricity
* Ideally some services like police, ambulance and fire

### Outside connections

You need at least one of the following types of outside connection:

* Highway
* Train
* Passenger ship
* Airport (note: not sure if residents can arrive this way)

> Local transport types, such as ferries, monorail and metro only work inside your city, they won't bring people in from outside.

To diagnose issues with outside connections, see: [Outside connections not working](Outside connections not working)

### TM:PE Users

* Check your [](Vehicle-Restrictions.md):
    * In [](Policies.md), set [](Vehicle Restriction Aggression) to **Low**
    * If that works, you've blocked some routes with vehicle restrictions
* Check your [](Junction-Restrictions.md):
    * Did you block pedestrian crossings near a station?
* Check your [](Lane-Arrows.md) and [](Lane-Connectors.md):
    * Did you block off access to a lane on a road by mistake?
    * Upgrading roads sometimes resets some or all of the lane settings - so always check!!
* Turn off [](Parking-AI.md):
    * If that fixes it, please let us know: [Report a bug](Report a bug)

### Mods

* If you have any of the following mods, disable them, exit to desktop, and then try starting a new map:

### Other

There are some other issues to check if none of the above has worked:

* No vehicles? See: [Vehicles not spawning](Vehicles not spawning)
* Houses must be fully constructed before people will move in:
    * Once constructed, it can take some minutes for people to start moving in - be patient
    * Click a house and then click the routes icon in its info panel - you'll see if anyone is en route to the house
* Make sure the game isn't paused (yes, this literally happened)
* Try different maps:
    * Some maps from the workshop are broken, and there's not much you can do to fix them
* Check your tax rates on the budget panel - don't have them too high otherwise nobody will want to live in your city

# Fixed?

If not, consult the internet, maybe there are some other solutions we didn't mention above.
