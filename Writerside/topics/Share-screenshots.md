# Share Screenshots

## Why we like screenshots

Words are great, but screenshots are better - they help us see what a problem looks like, or where it is.

## Taking screenshots

If you've not taken screenshots before, here's some guides for different operating systems:

* [Windows 10](https://www.howtogeek.com/226280/how-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10/)
* [Mac OS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201361)
* [Linux](https://itsfoss.com/take-screenshot-linux/)

You can also take screenshots using **Steam** and share them to your profile:

> **Mac users:** Don't use Steam Overlay - it causes all sorts of problems

* This requires Steam Overlay to be enabled
* With the game running, press **F12** to take a screenshot
    * For more information on getting it working, changing keyboard shortcut, etc.,
      see [this guide](http://www.skylinesplanningguide.com/2015/03/guide-to-taking-screenshot.html)

## Sharing screenshots

Windows / Mac / Linux screenshots:

* Upload the files to an image sharing service
* We like using: https://imgur.com
* After uploading you should see a URL to share to the image - that's what we need

Steam screenshots:

* After exiting the game, you'll see a pop-up Window in Steam
    * If you don't see the pop-up,
      check [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/154644349170123545/)
* Select the images to upload and then click upload
* After uploading, go to your profile and choose **Screenshots**
* Click the screenshot, and you should see the URL at the top of the image - that's what we need

## Where to post the URL

Post the link wherever it was you were discussing the problem (usually a Steam discussion topic or comments section).

For TM:PE users only:

* If it relates to an existing **GitHub** issue, just post it in to the text box and click the green button
    * To create a new issue, see: [](Report-a-Bug.md)
* If you're communicating via **Discord** please add some text saying what the image is (otherwise we won't know what
  we're supposed to be looking at)
