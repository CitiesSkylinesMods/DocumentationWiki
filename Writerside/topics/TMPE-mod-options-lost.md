# Symptom

> Note: If it's road/rail customisations (lane arrows, traffic lights, restrictions, etc.) that aren't saving, see [Road and Rail customisations lost](Road and Rail customisations lost) instead.

* Settings on the mod options screen are missing or aren't loading/saving

# Cause

This can be caused by:

* Not being in-game when opening mod options screen
* Bug in recent TM:PE update (especially if the mod was just updated)
* Conflict with other mods

# Solution

The settings are currently per-save, so you'll need to start a new game or load a save to use them.

If just one setting is failing:

* If you switch to an earlier version of TM:PE, it's likely that version doesn't include the newer features.
* Otherwise it's probably a bug in recent update - let us know (see link below)

If the options screen is empty, or showing settings for a different mod, make sure you don't have old version of [Vanilla Trees Remover](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=877950833) mod installed. The latest version of that mod fixes that bug.

If the options are overlapping, it's likely a bug - please let us know (see link below).
