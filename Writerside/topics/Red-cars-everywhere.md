# Red Cars Everywhere

> Article verified: November 2021

## Symptom

* My city is filled with lots of red cars.

## Cause

Known causes:

1. There is a bug in the vanilla **Black Woods** map which, for some reason, includes 327 red cars waiting to be
   parked (See [Issue #1101](https://github.com/CitiesSkylinesMods/TMPE/issues/1101) for details; CO will need to fix
   their map).
2. Default settings of the [Vehicle Wealthizer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1633580257) mod
   use red cars for one of the wealth levels, so you'll see concentrations of red cars in areas associated with that
   wealth level.
3. Subscribing lots of car assets from workshop that have red as one of their color options.

## Solution

1. If using Black Woods vanilla map, just use the despawn tools (in either TM:PE or AVO mods) to despawn all parked
   cars/vehicles.
2. If using Vehicle Wealthizer mod, edit the settings to add more cars to each wealth level.
3. You can use [Advanced Vehicle Options](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1548831935) mod to
   alter the colours of cars.

## Was it Fixed?

If not, it could be some other mod?
