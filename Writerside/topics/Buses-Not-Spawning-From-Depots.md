* Buses are not spawning from depots

## Cause

This bug is not caused by TM:PE.

There are numerous causes, however one that's specific to public transport is the Building Themes mod. (Yes, we know
that sounds crazy).

## Solution

Disable or unsubscribe [Building Themes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=466158459) mod.

## Was it Fixed?

If not, try:

* [](Tracked-vehicles-not-routing-or-spawning.md) â€” the notes on sharp angles can apply to buses
* [](Vehicles-not-spawning.md) -- applicable to all vehicle types
