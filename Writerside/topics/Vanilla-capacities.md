# Vanilla Capacities

> Article verified: June 2019

The table below shows the capacities of various types of vehicle from the base game.

### Why is this important?

Vehicles with significantly larger capacities will confuse the AI and cause problems.

Your hearse has capacity of 10, and there are 100 dead people:

* AI sends out 10 hearses, each of them visit 10 buildings

Your hearse has capacity of 100, and there are 100 dead people:

* AI sends out 1 hearse, and it has to visit 100 buildings!!

Ramping up capacity is generally a stupid idea. :)

Also, there are issues with public transport vehicles too - if their capacity is too big, the AI gets "stuck" on the
boarding phase.

So please try and keep vehicle capacities similar to the vanilla vehicles...
