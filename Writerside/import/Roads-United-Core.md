## Overview

> This article is just some general information for users who experience problems with Roads United mods/assets which are external to TM:PE.

Roads United Core mods allow you to retexture your roads by applying road themes.

## Core mods

Core mods apply road theme textures (from separate mods) to your roads.

There are two "Core" mods available:

* [Roads United Core 2.0](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=633547552)
* [Roads United Core+](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=726005715)

Only one of those mods should be used at a time. If you have both subscribed they will conflict and cause problems.

### Incompatible mods

> We strongly recommend using [Compatibility Report](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633433869) mod as it helps identify incompatibility problems and suggests solutions.

The Core mods _will break_ if you have any of the following mods subscribed:

* Road Options (Road Colors Changer ++)
* [DISCONTINUED] Road Color Changer Continued
* Road Color Changer (no longer in workshop)
* Remove Road Textures - Blank Roads
* Road Color 道路颜色修改中文汉化版
* Network Extensions Project (original verison; game breaking)

### Roads United Core 2.0

This mod is generally more reliable, however it won't retexture more recent Network Extension 2 roads.

### Roads United Core+

This mod can retexture more of the Network Extensions 2 roads, but it has some problems:

* It sometimes conflicts with TM:PE:
   * Workaround: In RUC+ mod options set **Road Theme** to vanilla, then set it to your desired theme.
* It **breaks toll booths** - see: [Toll Booths not working](Toll Booths not working)
   * It is marked as **Game Breaking** for this reason.

## Road themes

Road Themes are mods that contain road textures. The Core mod then applies the texures to roads.

If the road theme says it works with both "Core 2.0" and "Core+", choose the one that best suits your needs. Remember, you can only have _one_ Core mod subscribed at a time otherwise you will get problems.
