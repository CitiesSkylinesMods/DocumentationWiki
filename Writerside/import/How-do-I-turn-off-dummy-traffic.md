# Symptom

* Dummy traffic just drives in from edge of map and then drives out again
* How do I turn it off?

# Cause

The base game generates dummy traffic to make highways look busy even when your city is small.

# Solution

* Subscribe and enable [Optimised Outside Connections](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1721492498) mod
* In it's mod options you'll find settings to disable different kinds of dummy traffic

# Fixed?

If that doesn't stop the dummy traffic, what you are seeing is probably not dummy traffic. If you are sure that it is, it could be an error in the mod, please let the mod author know on their workshop page linked above.
