> # FIXED!
> TPB has fixed the bug in the Vanilla Trees Remover mod, this issue should no longer occur!

# Symptom

You click the options button for a mod, but it shows the options for the mod above or below instead.

# Cause

This bug is not caused by TM:PE.

It is caused by [Vanilla Trees Remover](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=877950833) mod.

The mod causes other issues within content manager and also mod options screens in-game.

# Solution

You can either:

* Unsubscribe the Vanilla Trees Remover mod (recommended), or
* Use [Sort Mod Settings](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=973512634) mod - this will _sometimes_ fix the Symptom listed above
    * It probably won't fix the other symptoms though (mods list blank, and missing content from options screens of other mods)

# Fixed?

If not, ask for assistance in Steam forums, reddit, etc.
