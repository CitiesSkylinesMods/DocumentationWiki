The toolbar and most tools can be accessed via keyboard shortcuts, which you can customise in [Keybinds](Keybinds) [settings](settings).

Use the [Hints Panel](Hints Panel) to quickly see what shortcuts are available for the active tool.

## Advisor tutorials

The first time you use the toolbar or a tool, advisor tutorials will be displayed. You can turn them off in [General](General) [settings](settings) if desired.

> You can redisplay context-sensitive advisor tutorials at any time by clicking the green **(?)** button near the roads menu on the game's menu bar.

## Moving the menu button and toolbar

You can drag the menu button and toolbar around the screen with the left mouse button.

To avoid accidental repositioning, you can lock their positions in [General](General) [settings](settings).

If you want to declutter your screen, you can move the activation buttons of multiple mods - including TM:PE - in to the [Unified UI](Unified UI) panel.

## Persistent Overlays

Most tools have an accompanying persistent summary overlay which visualies customisations of that tool on the map. The persistent overlays will be visible whenever the Toolbar is visible, regardless of which tool is active.

You can enable persistent overlays in [Overlays](Overlays) [settings](settings) and set their transparency in [General](General) [settings](settings).

Note that while a tool is active, it will often replace the persistent summary overlay with a more detailed overlay that contains more information.
