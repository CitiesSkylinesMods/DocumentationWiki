# Symptom

> Note: This issue might also occur with trams or metros, but so far we've only heard about it with busses.

* Busses are not spawning from depots

# Cause

This bug is not caused by TM:PE.

There are numerous causes, however one that's specific to public transport is the Building Themes mod. (Yes, we know that sounds crazy).

# Solution

Disable or unsubscribe [Building Themes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=466158459) mod.

# Fixed?

If not, try:

* [Tracked vehicles not routing or spawning](Tracked vehicles not routing or spawning) -- the notes on sharp angles can apply to busses
* [Vehicles not spawning](Vehicles not spawning) -- applicable to all vehicle types
