## Symptom

One or both of the following:

* A `System.StackOverflowException` error occurs and game might crash to desktop.
* Log file might show `StackOverflowException` error

# Causes

We have identified several mods that cause this error:

* Senior Citizens mod
* Favorite Cims
* Any mod that causes [Invalid list detected](Invalid list detected) error

There is also a possibility that Procedual Objects mod can cause the error if there's a malformed font installed, although we haven't been able to confirm that yet.

## Solutions

Senior Citizens mod:

* Unsubscribe the [Nursing Homes for Senior Citizens](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=554232266) mod
* Unsubscribe any assets it uses (retirement homes, nursing homes, hospice, etc)
* Exit to desktop then restart the game
