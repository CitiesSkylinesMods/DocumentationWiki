When editing text files, it's critical to use an editor that maintains _plain text_ UTF-8 format.

> ⚠️ Do _not_ use a word processor as it will add all sorts of garbage to the file.

Some example editors that we recommend:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (free, cross-platform)
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (free, Windows and Mac only)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (free, Windows only)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (paid, cross-platform)
* [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) (free or paid, Mac only)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free, cross-platform)

These can be used to view and edit `.txt`, `.md`, `.log`, `.csv`, `.xml` and `.cs` files.

Note, however, they can't compile C# source code to DLLs - you'll need an IDE for that, see: [Dev Tools](Dev Tools)
