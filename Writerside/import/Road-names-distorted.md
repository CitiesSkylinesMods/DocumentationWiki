# Symptom

* Road names are distorted / unreadable on the map

# Cause

This is a rare bug in the base game.

There are some indications that it can also be caused by old mods that remove district names or icons.

# Solution

Restart the game and see if that fixes it.

If not, check to see if you have any old mods that hide district names or policy icons. If so, unsubscribe them and use more recent [Hide It, Bobby!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513657277) or [Toggle It!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1764637396) mod instead.

# Fixed?

If not, it could be caused by other issues such as:

* [Clicking button makes text dissapear](Clicking button makes text dissapear)
* [Interface text missing](Interface text missing)
