# Symptom

* Cars are driving through red traffic lights
* This primarily affects [Timed traffic lights](Timed traffic lights) but can also affect normal traffic lights too

# Cause

This is caused by very short road segments at the junction.

For background information, see: [Issue #297](https://github.com/krzychu124/Cities-Skylines-Traffic-Manager-President-Edition/issues/297)

# Solution

Either rebuild the junction using longer road segments, or use [Move It](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619685021) mod to increase the length of road segments.
